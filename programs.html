        <p>This program places undergraduates in public service law organizations in the Cambridge/Boston area. During the term, interns learn how law can be used to enact social change. This program is meant to give students first-hand exposure to public service law by surrounding them with people who have experience in the field and allowing them to participate in the activities of renowned organizations, such as the Greater Boston Legal Services and the District Attorney's Office.</p>
  
        <p>Here are some of our current partner organizations this semester:</p>

            <h5>Fair Employment Project (FEP)</h5>
            <p> FEP counsels Massachusetts workers of limited means about their rights on the job and the legal process.
