## Mission Statement

The Harvard Undergraduate Legal Committee aims to connect undergraduates to public interest law organizations, law school students, and professionals in order to help undergraduates gain a deeper understanding of and appreciation for public service law careers.

Our short-term goals are the following:
To serve the local community by placing undergraduate volunteers in local public service law and advocacy organizations.
To provide undergraduates with an opportunity to experience public interest law first-hand by exposing them to community needs and allowing them to witness how law can be used to address these needs.
To use the law as a tool of social justice and empowerment for those who need it the most.
To develop close mentor relationships between the volunteers and their supervising attorneys, or between undergraduates and their law school mentors.
To provide undergraduates with opportunities to learn about public interest law through speaker events, field trips to pertinent government and law institutions, and an annual Public Interest and Law Conference.
To provide a forum for undergraduates interested in public interest law to express their views on current issues through the Public Interest Journal.

Programs

HULC is a hybrid of a pre-law and public service organization. We are the only student-run organization on campus that concentrates on public interest law, though we also welcome all students interest in law outside of the public interest realm.

We have several programs under our organization:

Internship Program - Places undergraduates in public service law organizations in the Cambridge/Boston area. During the term, interns learn how law can be used to enact social change. This program is meant to give students first-hand exposure to public service law by surrounding them with people who have experience in the field and allowing them to participate in the activities of renowned organizations, such as the Greater Boston Legal Services and the District Attorney's Office. Scroll down for more information on internship sites or access the application here! (If you are an organization looking to partner with the Harvard Undergraduate Legal Committee, please contact Lizz Jiang at elizabethjiang@college.harvard.edu.
Mentors and Speakers Program - Pairs members with Harvard law students in order to better understand the public interest law field. The Speaker Series offers an opportunity to explore different areas of public interest law through talks, discussions and lectures from professors and professionals. All members are welcome and encouraged to take part. For more information and on how you can participate or help in the planning, please contact James Holloway at jholloway@college.harvard.edu.
Outreach and Outings - Exposes students to public interest law careers and opportunities. Outreach and Outings also works to foster strong relationships with public interest law firms around the Boston area and student organizations at Harvard Law School. Through the Advocacy Campaign, members have the opportunity to work with legislators to draft laws. Field Trips to public interest law sites (court rooms, law firms, foster homes etc.) are open to all HULC members. For more information on these programs and how to participate, please contact Jack Smith at jacksmith@college.harvard.edu.
The Journal for Public Interest - Founded in the Spring of 2013 with the purpose of providing students with a forum to write on and discuss all things public interest related. With the creation of the JPI, HULC aims to foster a greater engagement on campus with public interest work. The JPI is entirely written and published by Harvard undergraduates, and the Journal does not ascribe to any particular ideology or viewpoint. Though the focus of the Journal is on issues that are relevant to the public interest, HULC seeks to unite students across all disciplines in order to provide a diverse range of perspectives and opinions. Articles and submissions on any topic are welcomed, so long as they have an eye towards the public interest. For more information and on how you can get involved, please contact Curtis Lahaie at clahaie@college.harvard.edu.

Spring 2015 Internship Offerings

The Legal Committee offers a variety of term-time and summer internships in law and public service. Internships are available at Boston and Cambridge public service law and advocacy organizations. These are great opportunities to gain legal experience and contribute substantially to projects furthering the cause of public interest law. Access the application here!

Greater Boston Legal Services - Housing Unit (2 Interns; 5-8 hours per week)
GBLS is a non-profit law firm that provides free legal services for low-income people in Boston and 31 surrounding cities and towns. GBLS offers representation to prevent homelessness (Housing Law Unit), obtain political asylum (Immigration Unit), obtain safety and financial stability for victims of domestic abuse (Family Law Unit), obtain and maintain critical basic income (Welfare Law Unit) and health care (Elder, Health and Disability Law Unit), prevent foreclosures (Consumer Law Unit) and workers' rights (Employment Law Unit). Two specialized units serve distinct populations (Asian Outreach Unit and Cambridge and Somerville Law Unit). Responsibilities include client interviewing, legal research/writing, assistance with court procedures, and possibly attending court sessions. This internship is an excellent opportunity to get a first-hand experience of working with a public service lawyer in an intense, understaffed environment, as volunteers will be doing challenging and meaningful work that will directly impact the lives of clients.

Project No One Leaves (2-3 interns, hours TBD + one/two Saturdays per month 10am-1pm)
PNOL is affiliated with the Harvard Legal Aid Bureau and focuses on anti-foreclosure work. Students canvass foreclosed properties in Boston neighborhoods on Saturdays from 10am-2pm and reach out to residents in order to help them secure legal assistance and community support that will help keep them in their homes. PNOL works closely with the Harvard Legal Aid Bureau and a coalition of lawyers, public interest investors and community groups to protect the rights of residents of foreclosed properties and advocate for legal changes in housing and foreclosure law. There are no prerequisites or other upfront requirements to participating. Interns are encouraged to attend Saturday canvasses if they can, but they are not a requirement. Interns could involved by assisting in the analysis of data that PNOL has amassed from having canvassed thousands of Boston homes -- analysis that assists PNOL and its community partners in determining the future trajectory of their foreclosure response efforts. Support is also needed in the preparation of route-optimized maps for canvasses and development of an improved, integrated system for mapping properties and analyzing canvassing results. Interns could also assist the PNOL President and Conference Planning Committee in coordinating PNOL's annual foreclosure response conference -- the nation's largest conference on the foreclosure crisis-- which is tentatively scheduled for March 2014. This would entail contacting speakers, assisting in the management of finances, and handling other administrative tasks. Helpful skills for these responsibilities could include rudimentary familiarity with data analysis (Excel at minimum -- knowledge of STATA or an equivalent program is a bonus), experience making maps or using mapping software, and experience with conference planning. Right now our biggest priorities are (1) planning and organizing our annual foreclosure response conference, which will be held from March 28-30, and (2) assisting our canvassing directors with mapping and route-making for canvasses and managing the data we obtain from them. Interns who would be interested in one or both of these areas would be preferred. However, people of all experiences and backgrounds and interests are encouraged to get involved!

Greater Boston Legal Services -- Immigration Unit (1 intern, hours TBD with GBLS)
At the Immigration Unit in the GBLS, we represent immigrants in immigration proceedings. We focus much of our work on asylum seekers, victims of domestic violence, unaccompanied minors and immigrants being targeted for detention and removal by the Department of Homeland Security. We represent our clients before the Department of Homeland Security, the Department of Justice and federal courts. The Harvard Immigration and Refugee clinic at GBLS, also part of Harvard Law School, is housed within our Unit at GBLS (11 law HLS students every semester). We are focusing on indigenous cases from Central America and the Andes, we have a long history of representing and working on law reform as it comes to gender and children's asylum claims. We view ourselves as practicing human rights law and work in the U.S. We have had great students in the past and look forward to working with a student this spring.
*Please note: A final interview is requested and will be conducted either in person or on phone with GBLS.

Community Legal Services and Counseling Center (1 intern, 5-8 hours/week)
Community Legal Services and Counseling Center (CLSACC) , located in Central Square, Cambridge, provides free civil legal aid and affordable mental health counseling to low income individuals in Cambridge and Greater Boston. Our legal services are in the areas of immigration law, housing/homelessness prevention, disability benefits, and family law/domestic violence. Services are provided by a small staff and over 100 volunteers. CLSACC is unique in the Boston area providing both legal assistance and psychotherapy/social work support under one roof. We presently have an internship opportunity with CLSACC's Immigration Unit that specializes in representing immigrants and refugees who are seeking political asylum and immigrant victims of domestic violence. Students interested in human rights would gain research experience and exposure to cutting edge human rights issues. Our program helps interns to develop their skills and broaden their perspectives on international human rights issues through focused, in-depth research projects. The position seeks to engage interns in a variety of tasks and opportunities associated with representation of asylum seekers. Interns will:

become familiar with issues relevant to U.S. Asylum law and international human rights
conduct country condition research on new and ongoing cases
assist lawyers with some administrative duties
Potential interns should show a strong interest in human rights and an eagerness to learn more about international affairs. Interns should be adept at research and have strong writing skills. They should be self-motivated, flexible, and reliable.
*Please note: A final interview is requested and will be conducted either in person or on the phone with CLSACC.

The Disability Law Center (1 intern, hours TBD)
The Disability Law Center (DLC) is the Protection and Advocacy agency for Massachusetts. DLC is a private, non-profit organization responsible for providing protection and advocacy for the rights of Massachusetts residents with disabilities. DLC receives federal, state and private funding but is not part of the state or federal government. Our mission is to provide legal advocacy on disability issues that promote the fundamental rights of all people with disabilities to participate fully and equally in the social and economic life of Massachusetts. We provide information, referral, technical assistance and representation regarding legal rights and services for people with disabilities. We provide legal services to eligible people and groups whose cases meet certain DLC priorities. We would like a student to help with a variety of legal tasks including some research, document review and intake. They would be exposed to a busy non-profit legal organization and have the opportunity to sit through weekly case review and interact with 10+ attorneys here at DLC. Expectation of time would be up to the program and the student. Although not required, we would love to have a student with a disability who thinks they want to work in this field if at all possible.

Environment MA (3 interns, 8+ hours/week)
Environment Massachusetts is a statewide environmental advocacy organization that works to protect clean air, clean water, and open space. We're working to clean up dirty power plants, protect the Cape Cod National Seashore and the Connecticut River, fight fracking, and bring more solar energy to our state. Interns will assist with all aspects of our campaigns, including reaching out to local newspapers and TV stations, building coalitions of local businesses, elected officials, and community organizations, recruiting and training volunteers, gathering petition signatures, and organizing lobby visits with elected officials.
*Please note: A final interview is requested and will be conducted with Environment MA.
